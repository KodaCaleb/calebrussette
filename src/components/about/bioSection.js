          Hello, I'm Caleb, a zealous web developer with a lifelong fascination
          with technology. Ever since I assembled my first computer at 14, I've
          been weaving intricate narratives through code, pouring hours each day
          into perfecting my craft.
          <br />
          <br />
          I approach each project with an eagerness to learn, viewing every line
          of code as an opportunity to tell a story, connecting logic with
          creativity. My writing passion extends to my work, bringing
          originality to everything from a simple UI tweak to complex full-stack
          applications.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whether I'm exploring full-stack, front-end, or back-end roles, I see
          each challenge as a stepping stone, a chance to grow and fine-tune my
          skill set. My approach to web development mirrors my love for
          nonfiction and storytelling: structured, meticulously organized, and
          always keeping the end-user in mind.
          <br />
          <br />
          It's not just about writing code; it's about creating user-friendly
          web experiences that resonate. I look forward to embarking on this
          evolving coding journey with you, ready to learn, grow, and create
          something truly remarkable.
